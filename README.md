# CodeReview (13th March 2024)
## Data
For this review I have provided a dataset of family trees with clones orignating from different tissues (fake_treedata.rds). The code I used to analyse and visualise the data is ori_plot.R.
The data is stored as lists of phylogenetic trees.
## Aims
It would be great to discuss simplification of the code, automation of the analysis and alternative/better ways of plotting the data.
