# CodeReview (13th March 2024)
## Data
For this review I have provided a dataset of cells orignating from different tissues (origin.rds). The code I used to analyse and visualise the data is ori_plot.R. 
## Aims
It would be great to discuss automation of the analysis and alternative/better ways of plotting the data.
